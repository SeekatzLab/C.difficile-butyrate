#### Abstract:

Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are products of bacterial fermentation that help maintain important gut functions such as the intestinal barrier, signaling, and immune homeostasis. The main SCFAs acetate, propionate, and butyrate have demonstrated beneficial effects for the host, including importance in combatting infections caused by pathogens such as Clostridioides difficile. Despite the potential role of SCFAs in mitigating C. difficile infection, their direct effect on C. difficile remains unclear. Through a set of in vitro experiments, we investigated how SCFAs influence C. difficile growth, sporulation, and toxin production. Similar to previous studies, we observed that butyrate decreased growth of C. difficile strain 630 in a dose-dependent manner. The presence of butyrate also increased C. difficile sporulation, with minimal increases in toxin production. RNA-Seq analysis validated our experimental results, demonstrating increased expression of sporulation-related genes in conjunction with alternative metabolic and related C. difficile regulatory pathways, such as the carbon catabolite repressor, CcpA. Collectively, these data suggest that butyrate may signal alternative C. difficile metabolic pathways, thus modifying its growth and virulence to persist in the gut environment.

#### Importance:

Several studies suggest that butyrate may be important in alleviating gut infections, such as reducing inflammation caused by the healthcare-associated Clostridioides difficile. While studies in both animal models and human studies correlate high levels of butyrate with reduced C. difficile burden, the direct impact of butyrate on C. difficile remains unclear. Our study demonstrates that butyrate directly influences C. difficile by increasing its sporulation and modifying its metabolism, potentially using butyrate as a biomarker to shift survival strategies in a changing gut environment. These data point to additional therapeutic approaches to combat C. difficile in a butyrate-directed manner.
